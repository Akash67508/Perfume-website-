        <h1 text-align="center;">About us</h1>
        <p>In the early 20th century, perfume manufacturing underwent significant transformations, marking a shift from traditional methods to more modern techniques. Previously, perfumes were primarily crafted using natural ingredients sourced from botanicals, flowers, and animal secretions. However, advancements in organic chemistry led to the synthesis of aromatic compounds, providing perfumers with a broader palette of scents to work with. This era saw the rise of iconic perfumers such as Coco Chanel and Fran√ßois Coty, who revolutionized the industry with their innovative blends. Manufacturing processes evolved as well, with the introduction of distillation, extraction, and blending methods to create complex fragrances. Production became more standardized, enabling mass manufacturing and widespread distribution. Glass bottles with intricate designs became the preferred packaging, adding a touch of elegance to the product. Moreover, advertising played a crucial role in shaping consumer perceptions, with brands employing elaborate marketing campaigns to promote their scents. Overall, the early 20th century marked a period of transition and innovation in the perfume industry, laying the foundation for its continued growth and evolution in the decades to come.</p>

        <p style = "margin-top: 30px; font-size: 10px;">Perfume contact, also known as fragrance contact dermatitis, occurs when skin comes into contact with a substance in a perfume or cologne that triggers an allergic reaction. This reaction can manifest as redness, itching, swelling, or even blistering in sensitive individuals. Common allergens include certain essential oils, preservatives, and chemicals used in fragrances. Those with a history of skin sensitivity or allergies are more prone to experiencing perfume contact dermatitis. Avoiding products with known allergens, opting for hypoallergenic options, or conducting patch tests before using new fragrances can help mitigate the risk of developing this uncomfortable skin condition.</p>
